-Data Science (UMich)

-Drew Conway's perspective on data science:
  Hacking skills
  Math and Statistics Knowledge
  Substantive expertise

-Other data science perspectives:
  Skepticism, experimentation, simulation, and replication

-Develop some communication skills in the form of charting, graphing, and
related visualizations. A good data scientist is one who can communicate their
findings clearly to others and having some fundamental tools in the toolkit as
useful here.

-David Donoho, Stanford University, article on the last 50 years of
Data Science and the direction the field is headed. This is a fairly long
and academic article, but is excellent overview of the field.

-The Full Scope of Data Science (From the paper above)

  -The Six Divisions

  1. Data Exploration and Preparation
  2. Data Representation and Transformation
  3. Computing with Data
  4. Data Modeling
  5. Data Visualization and Presentation
  6. Science about Data Science

Note:
  Infoviz is a field of its own and is closely associated with the 5th point
  above.
