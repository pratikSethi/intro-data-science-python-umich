-The Dataframe Data Structure
  This is the heart of the Panda's library
  It's a primary object that you'll be working with in data analysis
  and cleaning tasks.

  The DataFrame is conceptually a two-dimensional series object,
  where there's an index and multiple columns of content, with each
  column having a label. In fact, the distinction between a column and
  a row is really only a conceptual distinction. And you can think of
  the DataFrame itself as simply a two-axes labeled array.
