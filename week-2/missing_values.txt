-Missing Values

  fillna()

  ffill and bfill params of fillna

  It's sometimes useful to use forward filling, sometimes backwards filling,
  and sometimes useful to just use a single number. More recently, the Pandas
  team introduced a method of filling missing values with a series which is
  the same length as your DataFrame. This makes it easy to derive values which
  are missing if you have the underlying to do so. For instance, if you're
  dealing with receipts and you have a column for final price and a column for
  discount but are missing information from the original price column, you can
  fill this automatically using fillna.

  NOTE: When you use statistical functions on DataFrames, these functions
  typically ignore missing values. For instance if you try and calculate
  the mean value of a DataFrame, the underlying NumPy function will ignore
  missing values. This is usually what you want but you should be aware that
  values are being excluded.
