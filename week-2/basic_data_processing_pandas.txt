Basic Data Processing with Pandas

-The Series Data Structure
  Series()
  list to series and dict to series
  nan and None
  head()
  We see that mixed types for data values or index labels are no problem
  for Pandas.

Difference between NaN and None and how does efficiency reasons around it

-Querying a Series
  A panda.Series can be queried, either by the index position or the
  index label. As we saw, if you don't give an index to the series,
  the position and the label are effectively the same values

  iloc - index based attribute
  loc - label based attribute
  Safer to use iloc and loc attributes directly as compared to indexing op

-Vectorization in Numpy library
  a pretty shocking difference in the speed and demonstrates why data
  scientists need to be aware of parallel computing features and start
  thinking in functional programming terms

-Magic Functions in jupyter
  begin with a % sign. In jupyter notebook you can use '%' + 'tab'

  you can write your own magic functions too!!!

  Cellular Magic Functions - begin with 2 '%' sign
  %%timeit -n no_of_iterations

-Broadcasting in pandas and numpy
  Pandas does support iterating through a series much like a dictionary,
  allowing you to unpack values easily. But if you find yourself iterating
  through a series, you should question whether you're doing things in the
  best possible way.

  With broadcasting, you can apply an operation to every value in the series,
  changing the series.

  For instance, if we wanted to increase every random variable by 2, we
  could do so quickly using the += operator directly on the series object.

-Custom Vectorized Functions
  Go through the numpy documentation to understand this better.

-Gotchas
   the append method doesn't actually change the underlying series.
   It instead returns a new series which is made up of the two appended
   together

   This is actually a significant issue for new Pandas users who are used
   to objects being changed in place. So watch out for it, not just with
   append but with other Pandas functions as well.
